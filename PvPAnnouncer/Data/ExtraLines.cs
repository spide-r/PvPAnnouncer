    //todo: llumul, emet, zorral ja, magnai, sadu, etc - all the npc's people love but don't have a lot of voicelines
    //there might be some voicelines available but i either missed them or they dont exist in the normal voline clusters I found
    //gotta provide them and give a warning that they might be repetitive/quiet more often than the other announcers due to the low amt of lines
